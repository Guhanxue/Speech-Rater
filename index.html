						    <p> <span style="color:orange; font-size:100%;"> Total speaking fluency </span> refers to the ability of speakers to speak
							    the words about specific topics in English effortlessly and efficiently (automaticity) 
							    with meaningful expression that enhances the meaning of the topics (prosody). Fluency takes phonics or word recognition 
							    to the next level. While many speakers can decode words accurately, they may not be fluent or automatic in their word 
							    recognition in simultaneious speech. These speakers tend to expend too much of their limited mental energy on figuring out the pronunciation 
							    and meaning of words, energy that is taken away from that more important task in conveying intelligible ideas  — getting to 
							    the topics overall meaning. Thus, the lack of fluency often results in poor comunication. </p>

						    <p><span style="color:orange; font-size:100%;"> Fluent speakers</span>, on the other hand, are able to speak words accurately and effortlessly. They speak words and phrases instantly
							   on spot. A minimal amount of cognitive energy is expended in decoding the words. This means, then, that the maximum amount 
							   of a speaker’s cognitive energy can be directed to the all-important task of making sense of its ideas.</p>

						  <p>The <span style="color:orange; font-size:100%;">second component to fluency is prosody </span>, or speaking with expression. A key characteristic of fluent speakers 
							  (or speech, for that matter) is the ability to embed appropriate expression into the speaking.Fluent speakers raise and lower 
							  the volume and pitch of their voices, they speed up and slow down at appropriate places through the course of speech, they speak words in 
							  meaningful groups or phrases, they pause at appropriate places through the course of speech. All these are elements of expression, or what 
							  linguists have termed prosody. Prosody is essentially the melody of language as it is spoken. By embedding prosody in 
							  our oral language (read or spoken), we are adding meaning to the communication.</p>
					
					          <p> <span style="color:orange;">Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) </span> is employed for 
							  analyzing speech to find the underlying meaning or concepts of those used words in speech. If each word was only meant one 
							  concept, and each concept was only described by one word, then LSA would be easy since there is a simple mapping from words to concepts.
							  Since in languages words or a group of words or even spoken words in different intonation have diffirent meaning, the semantic analysis becomes a difficult tast to complete.
							  It means that the same group of words/words could convey multiple meanings and it might creates sorts of ambiguities in comprehensive communication between people. 
							  At this stage, we use LSA by <span style="color:orange;">introducing datasets which are represented</span> as (1) "bags of words", where the order of the words in a document 
							  is not important, only how many times each word appears being considered. (2) Concepts are represented as patterns of words that usually 
							  appear together in documents. (3) vectorizing Words which are transformed to hold only one meaning by considering their neighbouring words.
