## an ML &amp; deep learning algorithms/models to assess spoken English language proficiency 

<UL> 
<LI style="color:orange; font-size:130%;"> it transforms sounds/language into vectores in a n-dimension sphere in which each feature is vectorized to represent pronunciation, prosody, and language for further evaluation.
<LI style="color:orange; font-size:130%;"> The models range from parametric, non-parametric statistics to a Neural Networks architecture. The ETS scoring rubric philosophy was generally adopted for judgment on the spoken language proficiency level. This framework could change and be customized on demand.

Certainly, pre-recorded sounds can be analysed, some parts of acoustic features which contain key information will be vanished though. It happens when the sound is compressed during the digitalization process.
